# 3D Printed Guardian Sword

the Guardian Sword++ in the Breath of the Wild
So this guardian sword can be found in the Chaas Qeta shrine located in the Tenoko Island. It’s yielded by a guardian scout, so you’ll have to battle to get it. It has a decent attack rating of 40 points, but like most weapons in the game it won’t last long. So this one will last longer than the one in the game.
